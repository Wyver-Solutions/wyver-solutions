We are looking for special people to join our team, on either a permanent (full or part time considered) or an associate basis, in order to meet the growing demand for our services.

Take a look at our &#8220;[Day in the Life][1]&#8221; quiz, to help you decide if you&#8217;d like to join us.

You will have some key characteristics:

  1. A **consultative approach** to working with people. There is no script. But you will need to ask lots of questions,Â listen and change your approach accordingly.
  2. An **ability to quickly learn**, understand, and speak intelligently about new software applications and systems, their strengths and weaknesses, and their underlying technologies.
  3. An **ability to get deep into an organisation&#8217;s psyche** &#8211; to understand its culture, what drives it, and what may help or hinder it changing.
  4. An **ability to use language** that is appropriate to the people you are working with, including hard-core IT systems people & developers; human resources, internal communications and L&D people; and senior business managers, all with their own drivers, beliefs and preconceptions. Often you will need to act as translator between these disparate groups.
  5. A very strong **ability to communicate** &#8211; face-to-face, in virtual meetings, in written form, and with diagrams.
  6. Extremely high levels of **information literacy** and personal knowledge management capability.

If you have implementation and consulting experience with more than two of the following applications, or technologies, then you are the sort of person we are looking for:

  * Learning content management systems
  * Document management systems
  * Training administration systems
  * XML-based publishing
  * Learning management systems (especially Moodle)
  * Web content management systems

You may be asked to provide advice and support on best use of learning technologies, on learning design and on technology platforms. We won&#8217;t expect you to know all the answers, but you&#8217;ll be able to find out &#8211; through effective searching, and through the use of your own professional network.

You will need to be able to:

  * Gather client requirements and document them
  * Manage projects using a combination of &#8220;agile&#8221; and &#8220;waterfall&#8221; approaches (some sort of accreditation would be useful evidence here)
  * Train and support teams face-to-face and remotely
  * Explain the implications of client choices and decisions

Please [send us a link to your online CV][2], with a supporting message explaining how you believe your experience would help our clients.
