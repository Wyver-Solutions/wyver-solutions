Wyver Solutions is underpinned by two core values:

  1. Openness and honesty in all our dealings.
  2. Giving generously of our knowledge, time and money.

Anyone that works under the Wyver Solutions banner is signed up to these values.

At least 10% of our profits is given away to local and international charities; usually with an educational focus.
