notes:
    Know your tools - start simple - learn - stop or get better<br />
    Business model - Hold free tools lightly. If you're going to invest time in them, then consider how viable they are for the future.<br />
    Data protection - what data are you collecting? What legal reason? Where is it? How is it kept secure? What rights do people have over their data?<br />
    Security - use different passwords for each system
