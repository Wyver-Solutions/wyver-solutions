<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">There was a time, not long ago, when, to get a message to someone you had a small number of options:</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Go to visit them</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Send a telegram</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Send a letter</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Make a phone call</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Publish a book</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Publish an article or pamphlet</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Hold a meeting</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">The option chosen would depend on factors such as:</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">The number of people in your target audience</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">The sensitivity of the message you wanted to get across</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">The urgency of the message</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">The complexity of the message</span>

I<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">t was usually pretty obvious which solution was the right one for a particular situation. Although I&#8217;m sure there are examples of inappropriate use of a particular medium!</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Now, however, the choices available seem endless &#8211; and ever growing&#8230; A learning &amp; development professional now needs to be comfortable in far more media than ever before.</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">As well as the publicly available toolset, such as letters, emails, phone, texts (SMS), Twitter, Facebook, collaborative documents, instant messaging et al, a seasoned communicator will also have at their disposal tools such as blogs, wikis, private social networks, private collaboration spaces, audio &amp; video, VOIP, ebooks etc.</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">All of these may also be used in any combination.</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">It&#8217;s enough to make anyone&#8217;s heart sink!</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Over the next few weeks, we will be publishing a series of blog posts, each one highlighting a specific type of communication tool. We will offer best practice ideas based on our experience and provide examples of how they may be used in the context of Learning &amp;Development.<br /> We will also highlight things you may wish to consider if you&#8217;re looking to buy into one of the newer methods of communication.</span>

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">If there is a particular type of tool you would like us to focus on, please drop a note in the comments below.</span>
