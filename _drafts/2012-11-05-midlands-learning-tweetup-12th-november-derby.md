We will be attending the Midlands Learning Tweetup on Monday 12th November in Derby.

This will be a great opportunity to chat with people from across the institutional and corporate learning spectrum.

We&#8217;ll be meeting at <a href="http://www.brunswickderby.co.uk/" target="_blank">TheÂ Brunswick Inn</a>, Railway Terrace, Derby, DE1 2RU &#8211; from 6:30pm until whenever. The pub is very close to Derby Railway station, and there&#8217;s lots of on-street car parking in the area.

It&#8217;ll all be very informal!
