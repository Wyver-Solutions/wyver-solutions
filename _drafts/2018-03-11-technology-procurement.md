You've decided your organisation needs a new technology solution. Whether it's to help you manage events, content, people or whatever... it really doesn't matter.

What does matter is that you need to make sure the solution you buy is a good fit for your organisation.

Traditionally, that will be done by creating a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solution supplier will then write a response, which answers all your questions, in a way that the supplier hopes will sell their solution to you.

Then you'd gather some people to review the responses, score the answers, and identify a preferred supplier. After that it's just a matter of agreeing the terms of the contract...

Both the supplier and the buyer organisations are working in the dark. The suppliers are making assumptions galore as they answer the questions - often without really knowing much about how your organisation ticks, and what you really need. And you, the buyer, are buying something that you're hoping, without much evidence, will work in your particular situation.
