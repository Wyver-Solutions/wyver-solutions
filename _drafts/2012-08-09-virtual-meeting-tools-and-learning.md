<p lang="en-US">
  There seems to be a lot of talk at the moment regarding the use of online virtual meeting tools such <a href="http://www.webex.co.uk/" target="_blank">WebEx</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html" target="_blank">Adobe Connect</a> for the delivery of virtual instructor led training (vILT). This talk is often related to cost savings against travel and expenses budgets but what does it mean to move to this method of delivery?
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US">
  More savings
</h2>

<p lang="en-US">
  Savings are a big plus, not only in travel and expenses (especially if your organisation is geographically diverse) and this applies for both delegates and trainers.
</p>

<p lang="en-US">
  There are productivity gains to be had. Not only are the delegates &#8216;off the shop floor&#8217; for less time as sessions are shorter, but they are able to get back into the flow of their work quicker.
</p>

<p lang="en-US">
  There are productivity gains for L&amp;D teams too. With short sessions, and sessions split over a number of days, trainers can also get on with all the other work they have and this method of delivery also allow the trainer to work flexibly.
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US">
  Impact on learning
</h2>

<p lang="en-US">
  With vILT sessions lasting for about 2-2.5 hours, the amount of content that can be covered is easily digestible and, where a course may be chunked over a number of sessions, this affords time for reflection in between. There is also an opportunity to build into the design short post session exercises to help with this.  You could still bring in the whole course in the same amount of time as an ILT session &#8211; with time for a bag of chips on your way home!
</p>

<p lang="en-US">
  It could also be argued that, without the worry of work piling up as they are in the classroom for a day (or more!), delegates can really focus their attention as they lack this distraction. If they are focused more on their training then there&#8217;s more chance that it will stick.
</p>

<p lang="en-US">
  Our L&amp;D colleagues will be learning too and by investing in their professional development in order for them to design and deliver effective vILT sessions they are being equipped with vital skills for today’s organisations.
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US">
  What&#8217;s the experience like though?
</h2>

<p lang="en-US">
  These tools have a great deal of functionality so that sessions can be as interactive as possible: the ability to share desktops and applications; functions such as chat, polls and even assessments; and the ability to work collaboratively on virtual whiteboards and on documents. With thoughtful design and delivery these tools mean that both trainers and delegates will have very rich online interactions and dialogue.
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US">
  Will it work for every course?
</h2>

<p lang="en-US">
  Well it will work for more that you probably think. Of course, training that is heavily dependent on things like body language, say communication skills, will probably not wholly shift to this method. That being said a blended approach can be taken so that elements can be moved online.
</p>

<p lang="en-US">
  It’s also been said that management development, with its emphasis on soft skills, is hard to deliver using vILT but rest assured it can be done and there are a number of suppliers out there who do this, so if they can, you can.
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US">
  How well does it work?
</h2>

<p lang="en-US">
  In an organisation I&#8217;ve worked with, we recently delivered <a href="http://www.itil-officialsite.com/" target="_blank">ITIL Intermediate</a> courses online. They consisted of a series of 2.5 hour sessions backed up by some weekly work in an online community. Overall we saved around £100k on course costs, but what about the delegates? Well we’re pleased to say that against a UK average first time exam pass rate of 67% (global – 72%) our delegates achieved a massive 87% and 1 delegate even got an unheard of 100%.
</p>

<h2 lang="en-US">
  Good practice hints and tips
</h2>

  * <p lang="en-US">
      Give your T&amp;D designers and Deliverers training on the nuances of using this method. Don’t just train the tool.
    </p>

  * <p lang="en-US">
      Keep it simple. Although these tools have a lot of functionality, keep it simple at first and concentrate on using functionality to support the material being delivered. It will be easier on your trainers and also on your delegates. Remember they will be as new to this as you are.
    </p>

  * <p lang="en-US">
      Get delegates interacting as quickly as possible. Maybe put a question on screen for them to answer using the chat functionality, this will start to break down barriers between themselves and the remote trainer but also with their fellow delegates who may be in different offices and different countries.
    </p>

  * <p lang="en-US">
      Have a &#8216;producer&#8217; with you if possible, especially in the early days. This role entails helping sort out technical issues such as dialling in, audio or webcam issues and the like. They can also help follow chat conversations and highlight questions for the trainer who is busy delivering.
    </p>

  * <p lang="en-US">
      Provide clear communications to delegates. Ensure that they know how to log into the session and a suggestion is that they arrive early so that if there are any technical glitches they can be resolved in a timely way.
