Unsurprisingly, with all the changes that have happened this year, it&#8217;s taken a long time to produce the promised review. But this is not a hard book to read. It&#8217;s highly practical and relevant to anyone who has been asked to create digital learning content.

There are 18 well-structured chapters that start by setting out some basic ideas and principles about designing and creating digital content, then moving on to specific types of learning content, and finishing with a brief chapter that helps you to assess the quality of content.

Throughout the book there are useful illustrations and example screenshots. Colour printing would have helped to improve the readability of these, but that&#8217;s the trade-off you get for keeping the costs down. It only really becomes noticeable on a few of the detailed screenshots.

Clive has kept an extremely good balance between the practice of &#8220;learning design&#8221; and the processes, tools and techniques that can be used to implement it. It looks like he&#8217;s tried to keep it as technology-agnostic as possible, in order to extend the book&#8217;s useful life. Although this has led to some skimming over of current issues such as HTML5 and mobile delivery.

An index would have been useful to enable the book to act as more of a reference guide. And I would have liked to have seen more discussion of the role of learning content management systems. However  this might have detracted from the book&#8217;s stated purpose of supporting the designer, rather than supporting the production team.

This is a book I would recommend to anyone who is involved with creating digital learning materials. Even if you&#8217;ve been around the industry for a while there will be ideas to pick up. It would be an ideal sourcebook for any training course for new designers, and could even stimulate quite a few heated discussions amongst established design teams!
