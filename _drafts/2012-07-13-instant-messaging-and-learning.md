How many times, in your working life, have you lifted your head and asked the person opposite: &#8220;How do I do such and such?&#8221; or &#8220;Where do I find X?&#8221; or &#8220;What did you think of that document Y sent out yesterday?&#8221;

These conversations are an essential part of maintaining working relationships, but they&#8217;re also an essential part of learning about the organisation, about your part in it, and in developing your own professional standards.

Working remotely, as many people do now, it&#8217;s these conversations that we miss the most. You have to be much more intentional about your personal learning &amp;development. Conversations that we do have tend to be very focussed on the task in hand, and any questions or comments that you have prior to formal meetings have to be saved up.

Instant messaging has been around for a long time, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#History" target="_blank">Internet Relay Chat being invented in 1988</a>. But it&#8217;s only relatively recently that it&#8217;s made the jump to mainstream use. Applications such as Skype, Yahoo Messenger, Blackberry Messenger and Google Talk brought it into the home (and particularly onto mobile devices) with simple, friendly interfaces, and it&#8217;s now being picked up by organisations as a means of supporting dispersed workforces. Sometimes using the free tools, and sometimes using commercial tools in order to keep communications inside the organisation&#8217;s firewall.

## Best practices

Here are some simple tips to make sure that you get the best out of your instant messaging system:

  1. Encourage everyone to upload a profile picture of themselves, following the guidelines set out by <a href="http://topdogsocialmedia.com/successful-social-media-profile-picture/" target="_blank">Top Dog Social Media</a>. Faces are important for communication!
  2. Don&#8217;t be afraid to switch your status to &#8220;unavailable&#8221; if you don&#8217;t want to be disturbed. No one can see whether you&#8217;re working on something or not, so you need to tell them up front.
  3. Keep conversations brief. If they go on for a long time then a phone call would be much better use of time.
  4. Follow the rules of <a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html" target="_blank">Netiquette</a>, especially &#8220;<a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/rule1.html" target="_blank">Remember the Human</a>&#8220;.
  5. Don&#8217;t use an email, when an Instant Message (IM) would do. It&#8217;s immediate, it uses less bandwidth, and less storage. If the one of the largest IT companies in the world can <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/Newsroom/en-us/Press_Releases/2011/2011_02_07_01.htm" target="_blank">stop using email</a>, so can you.
