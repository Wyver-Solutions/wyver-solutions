Many people involved with teaching and training know that the way we interact and learn has changed massively in the past 20 years &#8211; since the World Wide Web became part of our common culture.

It has democratized news-gathering and encyclopedia building, played a part in revolutions, and resulted in huge amounts of creative, shared endeavour &#8211; from [2000-strong virtual choirs][1] to software containing nearly [2,000,000 lines of code][2].

Outside of our organisations and institutions, the people we support are playing their own part in this new, hyper-connected world. Every post on Facebook, every video published to Youtube, every purchase on Amazon and every search on Google adds to the combined knowledge of planet Earth. And these are just the big players. Millions of web-sites, all containing their own particular flavour of knowledge and ideas, vie for attention.

How are today&#8217;s learning professionals to respond to this glut of information and connected people? How should we contribute? Are there any rules? What works? And what should be avoided?

Wyver Solutions is launching a new [training service][3] designed around the needs of the modern learning professional &#8211; whether working in a school or a workplace &#8211; to enable you to quickly get to grips with some of the key ideas &#8211; through a combination of facilitated workshops and self-study.

We have created a [series of modules][4], to which we will be adding more over time.

Each module is built around the following learning model:

  * Consumption (eg. watching a video, reading a book)
  * Application (eg. trying out an idea or a tool)
  * Reflection (ie. thinking about what you have learnt)
  * Creation (eg. written reports, videos, podcasts)

This model fits our perception of what a modern learner and innovator is doing (just take a look at the TED video below for examples).

Support can be provided via live virtual meetings, or face-to-face &#8211; dependant on the size of the group, the subject matter, and the precise needs of the group.
