The Autumn meeting of the East Midlands Learning Technologists’ group for 2014 is due to take place on the **<span data-term="goog_121417682">22nd of October</span> at Loughborough College** and the theme is **&#8216;Mind the Gap! Mainstreaming and supporting innovation&#8217;. ** We&#8217;d like to hear your stories of how you discovered innovation, how you shared it, how you helped to change practice&#8230; or how you took a small innovative idea and made it big. As ever&#8230; we need you!!

## Call for presentations

We’d love to have some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha" target="_blank">PechaKucha</a> presentations from our community &#8211; 6 minute presentations with images &#8211; where you tell us about how you got over that awkward gap between a great idea and the reality of getting it into the mainstream. Small scale, large scale, online, offline, formal or informal learning&#8230; give us a taste of your experience and some food for thought.  We’re interested in presentations from across the learning spectrum – whether that’s Higher Education, Further Education, Schools, local government or the private sector, we’d like to hear from you.

Closing date for submitting presentation ideas is <span data-term="goog_121417683">5pm</span> on **<span data-term="goog_121417684">Friday 26th September 2014</span>** and we&#8217;ll confirm presenters during the first week of October.  So, to submit your ideas, head to the [submission form][1] (<http://goo.gl/ccVuye>) and fill out the details.
