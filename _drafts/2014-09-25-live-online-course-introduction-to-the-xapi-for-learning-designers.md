Our friend, <a href="http://tincanapi.co.uk/" target="_blank">Andrew Downes</a>, is leading a live online course for the <a href="http://www.elearningguild.com/" target="_blank">Elearning Guild</a> next week. It&#8217;s aimed at Learning Designers and how they can use the xAPI.

From the <a href="http://www.elearningguild.com/academy/content/3562/academy---live-online-learning-courses---introduction-to-the-xapi-for-elearning-designers" target="_blank">course blurb</a>:

> The Experience API (xAPI) is a new eLearning standard designed to replace SCORM for designing, tracking, and analyzing learning solutions. This introductory course, for designers of eLearning, will help you expand your thinking and practices in the design of your learning programs. You’ll learn what xAPI is, how it works, and its implications for learning design and analytics. You’ll learn how to more deeply blend learning experiences to improve and better target learning needs by designing xAPI-enabled learning programs.

Andrew is one of the leading global experts on implementing the xAPI, and an effective speaker and teacher.

This is nothing to do with Wyver Solutions, but we&#8217;d still recommend it!
