Much has been made, over the past few years, of the [70-20-10 model][1] for learning and development. It can provide a useful reference point for L&amp;D professionals to help them decide on the best approach to particular problems.

It&#8217;s also a useful set of headings against which we can consider which systems are needed in a typical learning and development toolkit.

## On the job experience

Let&#8217;s think about the systems and tools that people use at home to help them at the point of need:

  * Search
  * Social networks
  * Reference sources &#8211; text, video, audio, animations etc.
  * Media creation and sharing

Depending on individual preferences and prior knowledge, some people will go to a search engine straight away to find the answer to their question, others will ask a friend, and some will go straight to a known, trusted reference source.

It&#8217;s rare that these systems are used in isolation. Search will bring up results from the social networks and the reference sources. The posts in the social networks will link out to the reference sources, or to other people. The reference sources will make it easy to share new learning on the social networks, and may even have their own social networks built in. People create media and then it becomes part of a reference source.

It&#8217;s a challenge for organisations to keep up with the outside world. It may be that they just join in, and allow people to use their existing methods but to support work. Or the organisation may choose to create a &#8220;walled garden&#8221;, offering similar functionality, but isolated from the outside. Or there&#8217;s a middle ground &#8211; having separate systems that can accept and push information from and to the outside world.

But whatever we do, we can&#8217;t ignore it.

## Feedback from others

The [Manager Tools][2] team put coaching and feedback right at the centre of any good manager&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s an essential component for ongoing development. It&#8217;s not just managers that can give feedback though. Comments from colleagues on a piece of shared work can provide just the right input to do it better next time.

In order to give effective feedback, people need information on which to base that feedback. The key thing then is to make sure that the information you&#8217;re collecting is not just based on the data that&#8217;s easy to collect. Managers need to consider what is important first, and then find the data sources to help them measure the things that are important.

> Make the important measurable, not the measurable important.

There are all sorts of systems to help to collect and collate data. There are those that help you obtain information from other people (eg. 360 questionnaires or social network ratings/comments), those that analyse performance in simulations, and those that provide data about real performance as it happens (eg. sales figures).

What you use depends on what you&#8217;re Â trying to measure, and on the culture in your organisation.

## Structured courses and programmes

In Learning &amp;Development, we have majored on providing structured courses and programmes for many years. It has been the de facto method for most L&amp;D activity. It&#8217;s relatively easy to plan, to cost and to measure.

There will always be a place for such activity. Particularly for people learning about a something that is completely new to them. But, there&#8217;s a &#8220;point of diminishing return&#8221; ([Jay Cross][3]) for this sort of formal learning. As people become more expert in their field, then formal learning becomes less useful.

The systems that are needed for structured courses and programmes include those found in a typical learning management system:

  * Structured content delivery
  * Assessment
  * Learner administration
  * Resource management
  * Online classrooms
  * Discussion forums
  * Content management
  * Content creation
  * etc

The precise combination you need will depend, as always, on what you&#8217;re trying to achieve, and the context you&#8217;re working in. Most people only use a tiny proportion of the capabilities of their LMS, although it&#8217;s questionable whether that&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t need the extra functionality, or because the LMS is not friendly enough for people to want to explore its capabilities.

## An integrated toolkit

You can find applications which say they can cover every aspect of the categories above. In some cases this is true, although you&#8217;ll often find that the ease of moving particularly from formal to informal and back is less than optimum. You&#8217;ll need to weigh up the benefits of having everything in one place against those of using &#8220;best of breed&#8221; systems. But that&#8217;s for another post&#8230;
