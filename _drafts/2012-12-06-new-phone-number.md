You may have noticed that Wyver Solutions has a new phone number.

We can now be contacted at:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>0845 591 9586</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For those of you who want to know the technicalities, we&#8217;re using <a href="http://www.sipgate.co.uk">www.sipgate.co.uk</a> which provides a true, standards-compliant Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) service. Unlike Skype, we can use any SIP client that we prefer (I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.tlphn.com/">Telephone</a>, which was incredibly simple to set up and links to my Mac Address Book), and inbound phone calls and the number are free.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The whole process of setting up the phone number, installing the client and running the first test took about 20 minutes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Feel free to try out the new number, but don&#8217;t be surprised if you get the voicemail&#8230; we&#8217;re very busy at the moment!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The old number still works &#8211; so, don&#8217;t worry if that&#8217;s the one in your address book.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  NB. 0845 numbers are charged at your local rate (in the UK) from a BT landline. Calls from a mobile phone may cost more &#8211; sorry!
