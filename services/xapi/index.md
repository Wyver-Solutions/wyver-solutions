Wyver Solutions are specialists in working with the xAPI specification (also known as Tin Can API or Experience API).

At its simplest, xAPI allows one system (the activity provider) to send a message (known as a statement) to another system (the Learning Record Store) about something the user has done.

By choosing to adopt the xAPI, it allows you to release learning content and activities from the confines of the Learning Management System, and track both their usage and their real-life impact.

The paper below outlines the benefits of using the xAPI, and explores how to get the best out of it.

If you would like to find out how Wyver Solutions can help you implement xAPI, or just find out more about it, please <a href="/contact.html">get in touch</a>.
