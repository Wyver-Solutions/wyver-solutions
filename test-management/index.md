Managing testing of a whole learning solution, across multi-disciplinary teams, with multiple systems and a suite of Requirements Documents, can be pretty complex – particularly if you need to maintain an audit trail showing what has been done, when, why and by whom.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-805 alignright" src="http://www.wyversolutions.co.uk/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tl-logo-transparent-300x72.png" alt="TestLink logo" width="300" height="72" />][1]TestLink, a multi-user, open-source application, allows you to do just that:

  * collect and refine requirements
  * hold all the information about the testing on a particular project
  * track different versions of the requirements and the tests
  * manage the different roles in the testing process
  * provide clear reports against each stage of the process

As a TestLink administrator, it&#8217;s possible to set up multiple projects, and assigned users to each project, with different roles as appropriate.

There are then several main stages after that:

  1. Draft and validate the requirements (optional feature)
  2. Create test specifications, containing test suites that will cover each of the requirements
  3. Create test plans for different stages of the project, which might look at particular test suites
  4. Allocate the tests for execution by individual testers
  5. Execute the tests
  6. Rework the tests based on feedback
  7. Rerun the tests
  8. Provide reports on passed or failed tests

Our clients, if necessary, will have access to the Wyver Solutions TestLink system for use on your projects.
