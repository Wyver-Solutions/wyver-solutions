We often work through selected vendors, helping ensure that their products are implemented and used most effectively.

We also work directly with end-clients, providing advice and support where necessary to learning and development specialists and senior managers.

We will only recommend a product when it is the one we believe will best meet your needs, regardless of our vendor affiliations.

Our people have experience across national and local government, private sector and third sector organisations &#8211; working on a range of projects from supporting a charity&#8217;s social media and communications planning, through to managing the online learning component of large government-sponsored recruitment and training projects.
