Implementation support extends from the very smallest project to the largest.

For example, you may wish us to help a small group of people learn how incorporate a new technology into their working practices (eg. tablet devices, video cameras, social media, online meeting software).

Or you might want support in liaising with your supplier and your internal stakeholders during a new learning technology rollout.

We have experience across the skillsets required:

  * Project planning
  * Project management
  * Change management
  * Meeting facilitation
  * Learning materials design
  * Online and face-to-face training
  * Test management

[Call us][1] to discuss your particular needs.
