How do you differentiate between suppliers?

The first stage is to make sure you really understand what you&#8217;re asking of them. That can be achieved through a carefully written requirements and scoping document, or through a process of competitive dialogue that iterates towards a solution.

A well-run competitive dialogue can work extremely well, but it&#8217;s very intensive for all parties, and can take a long time to complete.

Creating a document that clearly sets out the need and the scope of the solution is often the best compromise.

It can help a great deal if someone with supplier-side experience assists in the writing of this document. They will know which questions that suppliers will want to ask of you. And they will know the questions that will help show up the knowledge, experience and abilities of the suppliers.
