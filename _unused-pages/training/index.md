With our background in teaching and workplace learning & development, we are ideally placed to provide training around many aspects of learning and technology.

Rather than pure &#8220;training&#8221;, we tend to operate a coaching approach:

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">A brief introduction to the topic or software under discussion &#8211; either face-to-face or online</span>
  2. Supported application of the ideas in your own context
  3. Follow-up meetings to pick up on issues, provoke deeper exploration, and suggest ways of working.

We have experts available in the following topics:

  * Running large-scale learning programmes
  * Learning solution design
  * Content design and delivery
  * Social media in a learning context
  * Content management systems in learning
  * Moodle and eFront administration and configuration
  * Moodle and eFront course design
