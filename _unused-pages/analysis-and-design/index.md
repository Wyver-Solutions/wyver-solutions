You know you&#8217;ve got a problem to solve. It might be that your organisation&#8217;s outgrown its existing learning systems, or you know you&#8217;re falling behind in terms of supporting learning & development, or you may have a specific learning objective.

Our consultants will work with you to understand your organisation, its culture, your people, and what you&#8217;re trying to achieve. They will recommend innovative solutions that take into account current practice both inside and outside your organisation.

Often the solutions won&#8217;t be the ones you were expecting.

Our consultants will:

  * Ask the difficult questions that make you think about what you&#8217;re really trying to achieve
  * Translate when there are people from IT, Learning & Development and the business in the same room
  * Demonstrate possible solutions, contextualised for your particular needs

Some people call us &#8220;Solutions Architects&#8221;. Like an architect for the built environment, we understand how to bring together various technology components and make them work within your organisational environment.

Our specialisms include:

  * Experience API (aka Tin Can API)  
    See our booklet/white paper on [exploring the potential of xAPI][1]
  * SystemsÂ design
  * Software selection
