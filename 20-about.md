Wyver Solutions is a learning technology architecture practice &#8211; specialising in providing support, advice and training at the interface between learning, business and technology.

As well as the standard corporate and academic learning technologies, we also keep a close eye on the technologies being used by wider society or enterprise IT. Many of these can play a part in supporting learning, without significant extra expense.

We are not afraid to tell you if there is a better & less expensive way &#8211; even if that will result in less work for us. Our aim is to build up long-term relationships centred on trust, rather than short-term expediency.
