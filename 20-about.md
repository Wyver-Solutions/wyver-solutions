## How I remain independent

Precisely who I bring in or recommend is dependent only on your particular requirements. I value my independence, and therefore only enter into agreements with suppliers where I can maintain that independence. I do not receive any commission or kick-backs for any introductions made.

Some suppliers use me to provide solution design, implementation leadership and project management services. To avoid conflicts of interest, my preference is to offer this as an independent service directly to my customers, and to only work for the suppliers when *they* have brought me into *their* customers.

When working on your behalf, I are able to put your interests first. A clear line of accountability helps this greatly!
