Wyver Solutions is a learning technology architecture practice &#8211; specialising in providing support, advice and training at the interface between learning, business and technology.

We believe that communication, and by extension, conversation, is at the heart of learning. It is through conversation that we refine our ideas, our thinking and our behaviour.

As well as the standard corporate and academic learning technologies, we also keep a close eye on the technologies being used by wider society or enterprise IT. Many of these can play a part in supporting learning, without significant extra expense.

We are not afraid to tell you if there is a better & less expensive way &#8211; even if that will result in less work for us. Our aim is to build up long-term relationships centred on trust, rather than short-term expediency.

Wyver Solutions is based around people who are:

  1. experts in their field
  2. able to communicate with a range of audiences
  3. good listeners
