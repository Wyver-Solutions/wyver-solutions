## Learning technology review

Every few years, it's a good idea to review how well the technologies you have in place are helping your employees or clients to learn.

We take a wide view, across your whole technology landscape to assess its effectiveness and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Learning technology solutions architecture

Whether you want to bring in some new ideas on top of your existing technology landscape, or you are starting from scratch, we can help you to design a solution that works in your context.

Our focus is on creating a solution that will meet the needs of its users. Where appropriate we follow the guidelines provided for agile projects in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" target="_blank">UK Government Service Manual</a>. We have found that these work in many contexts, not just public sector services.
