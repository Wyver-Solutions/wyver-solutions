### Troubleshooting and Consultancy

Sometimes it&#8217;s helpful to sit down with your colleagues and an expert facilitator to understand how a new technology might fit into your particular context, or explore your technology strategy.

Or you may have an existing technology solution, and are wanting to make better use of it.

Or you might have implemented a solution that just isn&#8217;t working quite right.

You may be looking at mobile, social networking, video, single-source content management, xAPI or any of the whole host of new learning technologies coming onto the market.

We won&#8217;t push any particular product, but we will help you to get an overview of what&#8217;s possible and the range of solutions available to you.

### Analysis &amp; Design

You know you&#8217;ve got a problem to solve. It might be that your organisation&#8217;s outgrown its existing learning systems, or you know you&#8217;re falling behind in terms of supporting learning & development, or you may have a specific learning objective.

Our consultants will work with you to understand your organisation, its culture, your people, and what you&#8217;re trying to achieve. They will recommend innovative solutions that take into account current practice both inside and outside your organisation.

Often the solutions won&#8217;t be the ones you were expecting.

Our consultants will:

  * Ask the difficult questions that make you think about what you&#8217;re really trying to achieve
  * Translate when there are people from IT, Learning & Development and the business in the same room
  * Demonstrate possible solutions, contextualised for your particular needs

Some people call us &#8220;Solutions Architects&#8221;. Like an architect for the built environment, we understand how to bring together various technology components and make them work within your organisational environment.

### Supplier Selection

How do you differentiate between suppliers?

The first stage is to make sure you really understand what you&#8217;re asking of them. That can be achieved through a carefully written requirements and scoping document, or through a process of competitive dialogue that iterates towards a solution.

A well-run competitive dialogue can work extremely well, but it&#8217;s very intensive for all parties, and can take a long time to complete.

Creating a document that clearly sets out the need and the scope of the solution is often the best compromise.

It can help a great deal if someone with supplier-side experience assists in the writing of this document. They will know which questions that suppliers will want to ask of you. And they will know the questions that will help show up the knowledge, experience and abilities of the suppliers.

### Implementation Support

Implementation support extends from the very smallest project to the largest.

For example, you may wish us to help a small group of people learn how incorporate a new technology into their working practices (eg. tablet devices, video cameras, social media, online meeting software).

Or you might want support in liaising with your supplier and your internal stakeholders during a new learning technology rollout.
